### Water

Peerless village has its own water source. It's not drinkable and sometimes has dirt especially on rainy days. 

Prepare some anti-fungal cream. It get itchy sometimes. 

Water is only available in the morning from 5AM to 10AM then in the afternoon from 5PM-10PM. 

On rare occasions, there won't be any running water so it's wise to have big water containers always filled full.

Water rate is **40php per cubic meter**. The minimum amount payable is 360php. So even if you don't use their service you still need to shell out some money.
